# Galaxy Zoo with FastAI-v1

My solution to the [Galaxy Zoo Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge), using a ResNet-50 trained with transfer learning using FastAI-v1. I achieve a validation error in the top 3 scores of the original competition. 

What I did is detailed in my blog post: [http://jimypbr.github.io/2019/09/galaxy-zoo-kaggle-competition-redux-with-fast-ai](http://jimypbr.github.io/2019/09/galaxy-zoo-kaggle-competition-redux-with-fast-ai)
